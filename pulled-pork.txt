Pulled Pork Recipe (8 Hours cook time)

Food Ingredients:

5 lbs of Pork Shoulder/Butt
2 Large Onions
1 cup of Chicken Broth
Chili Powder
Salt
Pepper
Garlic Powder

Cooking Tools:
Slow Cooker (crockpot)

Cut up onions and place at bottom of crockpot. Pour chicken broth into crockpit. Add the pork (I use boneless). Next, season the pork with chili powder, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Turn the crockpot on low, and let cook for 8 hours. When done, remove the pork onto a plate. Using a strainer, drain all of the liquid, saving the juice. Use forks to separate the meat and add back to crock pot. Add juice as necessary to moisten. I usually end up adding about half the juice back.
